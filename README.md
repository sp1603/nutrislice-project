# About
This project aims to improve the dining experience at Georgia Tech by providing comprehensive nutritional information for all dining halls. Georgia Tech's dining halls currently lack detailed nutrition information for their menu items. This project leverages the Nutrislice API to retrieve and display this information, ensuring students can make informed dietary choices. It is built using Node JS, React, and a Next JS framework.

# Features
Nutritional Information Access: Retrieve detailed nutritional data for all menu items available at Georgia Tech dining halls.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface for students to search and view nutritional information.
Real-Time Data: Regular updates to ensure the most current menu and nutritional information is available.
